# Confidence Interval Visualizations - Shiny App


The app is designed to help users visualize confidence intervals by generating 
data from a normal distribution with user-specified parameters. It constructs
one-sample Z intervals assuming a known population standard deviation and allows
examination of how these intervals cover the true mean across numerous samples. 
The interface shows the intervals' performance over up to 10,000 samples and
includes several different visualizations and tables to depict the sample means,
and other summary statistics.
