# Confidence Interval Visualizations - Shiny App

[original](https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/CIVis/)


This app facilitates understanding confidence interval coverage rates by simulating data 
from a user-defined normal distribution, allowing for the adjustment of sample size and 
confidence level. It graphically represents one-sample Z intervals, where the population 
standard deviation is presumed known, and demonstrates the intervals' efficacy in 
encompassing the true mean through repeated sampling up to 10,000 times. The app provides 
details on the latest sample and displays the sampling distribution of sample means with 
visual demarcations for intervals that do and do not contain the true mean.
