# Confidence Interval Visualizations - Shiny App

[original](https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/CIVis/)


The app is designed to help users visualize confidence intervals by generating data from 
a normal distribution with user-specified parameters. It constructs one-sample Z intervals
assuming a known population standard deviation and allows examination of how these intervals 
cover the true mean across numerous samples. The interface shows the intervals' performance
over up to 10,000 samples and includes a histogram to depict the distribution of sample means,
highlighting instances where the true mean is both included and excluded by the generated
intervals. Details on the most recent sample are readily available for user reference.
